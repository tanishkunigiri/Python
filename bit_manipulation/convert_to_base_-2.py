def baseNeg2(n: int) -> str:
    """
    Converts an integer 'n' to its negative base (-2) representation and returns it as a string.

    The negative base (-2) representation is a positional numeral system in which:
    - The base is -2.
    - The only digits allowed are '0' and '1'.
    - The value of the number is calculated as follows:
        - Let's say the number is 'n'.
        - Starting from the rightmost digit, the value at each position is determined by (-2)^position * digit.
        - The sum of these values at all positions gives the decimal value of the number 'n'.

    Parameters:
    - n (int): The integer to be converted to its negative base (-2) representation.

    Returns:
    - str: The negative base (-2) representation of the input integer 'n' as a string.

    Examples:
    >>> baseNeg2(0)
    '0'

    >>> baseNeg2(1)
    '1'

    >>> baseNeg2(2)
    '110'

    >>> baseNeg2(3)
    '111'

    >>> baseNeg2(-3)
    '1101'

    >>> baseNeg2(10)
    '11110'

    >>> baseNeg2(-10)
    '1010'

    Edge Cases:
    - If the input 'n' is 0, the function returns "0" since the negative base (-2) representation of 0 is "0".

    Errors for Incorrect Input:
    1. If the input 'n' is not an integer, a TypeError will be raised, as the function expects 'n' to be an integer.
    >>> baseNeg2("abc")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Input 'n' must be an integer

    2. If 'n' is not in the expected range for the negative base (-2) representation, the result may not be valid, but no specific error will be raised.
    >>> baseNeg2(0.5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Input 'n' must be an integer

    >>> baseNeg2(-0.5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Input 'n' must be an integer

    >>> baseNeg2(255)
    '100000011'
